**Tamagotchi-esque app that eats your music**

* Last.fm API to grab user's latest scrobble
* Tkinter for a lightweight UI

## Things to implement
* Cycle through different tamagotchi emotions
* Refresh latest scrobble ~every 10-20 minutes
* Random phrases to print when eating
* Maybe store statistics on what types of music users feed their tamagotchi
